-- Hi, there!  Thanks for checking out my interview submission :)

-- I coded everything in VS Code, as my home machine is a mac, and VS is discontinued now for mac. 

-- You might need the following to run everything via VS Code
C# for Visual Studio Code 
    https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-dotnettools.csharp
.NET 8.0 SDK
    https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/8.0

-- navigate to the root of the repository checkout

-- if you have not already trusted the dev-certs run the following, via a VS Code terminal
dotnet dev-certs https --trust

-- then start by running the backend API project (.Net8), via a VS Code terminal
dotnet run --launch-profile https

-- Next you will launch the angular front end
-- navigate to /ui/customer-db, via another VS Code terminal, and run the following
npm install
ng serve -o

-- NOW from the opened browser explore the app
